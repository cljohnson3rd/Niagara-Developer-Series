# Niagara-Developer-Series

Welcome to the Niagara Developer Series! This is intended to guide you through the process of creating your first module!

This is not a replacement for the Niagara Developer Training Certification. This is merely a stepping stone to help you feel more confident in taking the course!

All code is fairly basic and not optimized. It's intent is to teach you how components are created, not necessarily take these components and immediately use them in the real world.
